## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**noobrysal/noobrysal** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on UDA - Unified Dashboard Analytics
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and Django
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on future projects!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with React
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Soulsborn/likes (lol)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: discord: bobberserker
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love everything about the Souls genre.
